I first typed ¡§ls¡¨ and the terminal of my MacBook showed the contents of a directories on my device. Secondly, I typed ¡§cd Documents¡¨ to change the working directory. After that, I was directed to the Documents folder of my device.Thirdly, I typed ¡§ls -a¡¨ to see what files the Documents folder has. What harassed me most is the command ¡§git add¡¨. I tried many times but my terminal kept showing, ¡§Fatal: pathspec 'file.txt' did not match any files.¡¨ I finally fixed this problem by typing ¡§git commit -m <file name>¡¨. After committing my file, I was able to do the command of ¡§git add¡¨ and the terminal successfully showed the following words:(base) Hinde-MacBook-Air:Test hinmingfrankiechik$ git commit -m "first commit"[master (root-commit) 6f62bf2] first commit Committer: Hin Ming Frankie Chik <hinmingfrankiechik@Hinde-MacBook-Air.local>Your name and email address were configured automatically basedon your username and hostname.
