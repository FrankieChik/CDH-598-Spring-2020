I first typed ¡§ls¡¨ and the terminal of my MacBook showed the contents of a directories on my device. 
Secondly, I typed ¡§cd Documents¡¨ to change the working directory. After that, I was directed to the Documents folder of my device.
Thirdly, I typed ¡§ls -a¡¨ to see what files the Documents folder has. 
What harassed me most is the command ¡§git add¡¨. I tried many times but my terminal kept showing, ¡§Fatal: pathspec 'file.txt' did not match any files.¡¨ I finally fixed this problem by typing ¡§git commit -m <file name>¡¨. After committing my file, I was able to do the command of ¡§git add¡¨ and the terminal successfully showed the following words:
(base) Hinde-MacBook-Air:Test hinmingfrankiechik$ git commit -m "first commit"
[master (root-commit) 6f62bf2] first commit
 Committer: Hin Ming Frankie Chik <hinmingfrankiechik@Hinde-MacBook-Air.local>

And then, I tried to link the github repository. After typing git remote add origin https://github.com/FrankieChik/CDH-598-Spring-2020.git, the system requested me to enter the username and password of my github account. After entering my information, it showed:

 * [new branch]      master -> master
Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.

At the end, I typed ¡§git pull¡¨ and the system said it is ¡§Already up to date.¡¨

“A little "thank you" that you will say to someone for a "little favour" shown to you is a key to unlock the doors that hide unseen "greater favours". Learn to say "thank you" and why not?”
